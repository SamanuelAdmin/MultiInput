<p>
The goal of the project is to create software that <strong>combines different systems and input devices into one</strong> via local network, so users can work more easily without setting up each part separately and <strong>with minimal delays</strong>.
The idea for the project came up back in 2024, when our team was developing and testing cross-platform apps. Existing solutions like AnyDesk and TeamViewer didn’t offer the interface we needed, were too slow, and didn’t support multiple devices comfortably.
</p>
<p>The project is <strong>at the stage of developing the first prototype</strong> right now. You can share your ideas for the project in the “issues” section — this will help us notice your comment faster.</p>
