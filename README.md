<p>
The goal of the project is to create software that **combines different systems and input devices into one** via local network, so users can work more easily without setting up each part separately and **with minimal delays**.
The idea for the project came up back in 2024, when our team was developing and testing cross-platform apps. Existing solutions like AnyDesk and TeamViewer didn’t offer the interface we needed, were too slow, and didn’t support multiple devices comfortably.
</p>
<p>The project is **at the stage of developing the first prototype** right now. You can share your ideas for the project in the “issues” section — this will help us notice your comment faster.</p>


:star: And star us on GitHub — it motivates us a lot!
